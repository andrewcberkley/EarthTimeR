# EarthTimeR
 EarthTimeR is a package created to make data wrangling easier before ingesting data into EarthTime, which is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University's CREATE Lab and the World Economic Forum allowing individuals to examine major environmental, social, and political phenomenon across time, across space, and between each other.
